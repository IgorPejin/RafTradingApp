# RafTradingApp

Android application for trading news and shares. Users can log in, see the latest trading news and detailed information about shares and buy or sell them. 


This is a school project where we learned about:

- Basics of Kotlin language.
- Activities, fragments, architecture
- Shared preferences and user login
- Retrofit (getting data from API)
- Koin (dependency injection)
- Room (for caching data to local database)

Jetpack compose was used for Login activity and Glide was used for images.

All graphs are done using MPAndroidChart - com.github.PhilJay:MPAndroidChart:v3.1.0
